# DVD Screen Saver

This is a plugin for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) that adds a new 
source type that can turn any image into a DVD style screen saver. Use it just
for fun, or make your "back soon" scene more interesting, perhaps use it as a
channel point redemption or when you need to watermark your your live stream
with a moving image 🛡️

It is the continuation of the original [dvds3](https://github.com/univrsal/dvds3)
plugin by [univrsal](https://github.com/univrsal), inspired by
[some patches](https://github.com/Ayowel/dvds3/commit/c177440488d716e950bbb042654d9de1f18fffdc)
by [Ayowel](https://github.com/Ayowel) and all wrapped up in the
[OBS Plugin Template](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate) so that
it builds 🧱 from source against current versions of OBS Studio.

**This project is a work in progress**, it builds for Linux 🐧 and is included in
[OBS Studio Portable](https://github.com/wimpysworld/obs-studio-portable).
Windows 🪟 builds in CI but macOS 🍏 needs some work 🩹
