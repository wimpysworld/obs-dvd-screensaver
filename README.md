# DVD Screen Saver

This is a plugin for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) that adds a source that presents a DVD
style screen saver. It is the continuation of the original [dvds3](https://github.com/univrsal/dvds3)
plugin by [univrsal](https://github.com/univrsal), along with
[some patches](https://github.com/Ayowel/dvds3/commit/c177440488d716e950bbb042654d9de1f18fffdc)
by [Ayowel](https://github.com/Ayowel) all wrapped up the [OBS Plugin Template](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate)
so that it builds from source against current versions of OBS Studio.

This project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.
